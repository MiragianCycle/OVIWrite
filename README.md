**A Vim/NeoVim Configuration for Writing and Writers**

## FAQ

#### WHAT THE HECK IS 'OVIWrite'?
OVIWrite (as in *Oh-Vi-Write*) is an attempt to make (Neo)Vim writer friendly out of the box?


#### WHY?

I am a writer, not a tech person. Coming across Vim for the first time last year was revelatory, but I'd be lying if I said the adoption process was easy. Indeed, it took me over two months to get Vim ready for my writing workflow. The result is that most writers would abandon Vim as too complex a beast. This repo is an attempt to address that potential loss of a user-group who stand to gain much from Vim.
