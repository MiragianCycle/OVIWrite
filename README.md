**A Vim/NeoVim Configuration for Writing and Writers**

OviWrite is a Neovim setup powered by [LazyVim](https://lazyvim.github.io/) and [💤 lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
to make it easy for writers to start using NeoVim out of the box. 

Vim and NeoVim make for great writing environments, and it is my hope that this is the basis upon which I can build an **Integrated Writing Environment** for myself. This IWE should be able to write in Markdown, LaTeX, Fountain (For Screenwriting) while, at the same time, having allowing the user to build a Personal Knowledge Base system (such as a Zettlekasten). 

This setup is built to be as frictionless as possible for a reasonably experienced NeoVim user to install and get to writing. I myself use this setup for the following use-cases:

- LaTex documents for my novels
- Fountain files for writing scripts and screenplays
- Markdown and Org Mode files for writing essays
- Vim-wiki for my personal Zettlekasten 

I have tested this config on Linux, MacOS and Android (through Termux available on the F-Droid store [not Google Play Store]).
Windows users: I would love feedback on your experiences as well as contributions.

The documentation here, much like the source code, is a fork of Lazy Vim. Thanks to the good folk there who have done an incredible job making this NeoVim distribution frictionless for us non-tech folk.
